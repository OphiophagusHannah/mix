                              <p>
                     Main functionality of application includes interactive virtualization of mixing cocktails, save and share them, search through cocktails and liqueurs to obtain more information about them, save and store them in your own space for later quick access.

                  <p>
                  Current mobile technology allow different kinds of interaction with devise, which can be useful for simulating mixology experience. Application will be used on mobile device and desktop (this prototype created for mobile only). Looking further, there are some new inventions on robotic bar systems, cocktail making machines, and taste simulating cups, which could be controlled wirelessly. In this case, part of this framework can be a virtual part of the interface for those devices.

                  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                  <p>
						   Primarily, this application will be used by mixologists and bartenders to expand knowledge through framework and exchange experience through network within this framework. It can be used in context of work/business, or just for personal reasons. Based on some of my previous research and target audience needs identification, most of applications or websites about mixology contain a large amount of descriptions and recipes, but it still not easy to find appropriate iteration and combinations, as well as get enough feedback or advice.

                  General goals of this user testing are to find out major and minor problems with general navigation flows and layouts. Beside this, there were a focus on accumulation of more opinions about how this application would be useful, which areas could be a larger focus of the app, exploration of audience's' needs, desires and comfort while interacting with virtualization.

                  <p class="info">1. Interaction</p>
                   Some ideas of interaction could not be included in this prototype. For instance, While mixing drink on the mobile app, the user can shake, turn, tap and hold icons that are needed. Current prototype does not include these options and uses only basic UI interactions.

                  <p>
                  <p class="info">2. Database</p>
                  Application includes database and process of database creation with users input. The prototype includes basic simulation of this function. Nevertheless, it does not work perfectly. Also, because of the size of the database, this prototype touches only part of it for exploring functionality, which creates some limits for user testing.

                  All five participants in testing have different level of experience with mixology and bartending, nevertheless, all of them have basic knowledge in this fields. All of them completed 6 tasks successfully with occasional minor confusion.

                  <p>
                  Participants found this interaction entertaining, new, and useful for not only target audience, but also for beginners, or those who wants to organize a party. Most of the participants were more interested in drink creation interactive process and felt like playing a game while completing that task. One of the participants were very excited about having a space to organize and keep all new interesting iterations of drinks as well as having quick access to them.

                              <p>
                     One of the main observations is that audience of different types were attracted to different parts of the application: bartenders are more excited about easy accessible storage for their cocktails and favorite cocktails, as well as getting to know more about them. Mixologists were more attracted to interactive mixology experience. Throughout testing, a lot need of improvement found in navigation and content organization fields.

                  <h5>Global UI</h5>

                  <p>
                  The biggest problem that found in user testing were a confusion with menus and global UI. Most participants were confused about either how to go back to main menu, or how to change between liqueurs and cocktails search or how to access favorite cocktails and my shelf. To eliminate this major issue, global UI that will be displayed on every page should be included.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Pathways</h5>
                  <p>
                  While observing interaction with prototype, some not necessary steps were found. There is no need of separation of major tasks under more global categories. Decreasing depth of pathways can eliminate confusion in users, as well as will display more choice of tasks right away.

                  <p>
                  Some assets and details could be organized better according to Gestalt principles. Changes of button sizes and their grouping will increase interaction quality especially in field as "Sorting/searching by", "Main menu", and "Single Cocktail Display". Nevertheless, visual presentation of search and cocktail creation fields were straightforward to participants.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Composition</h5>
                  <p>
                  General layout is clean, but some of the empty space could be used to tackle a problem with depth of information of organization and building global UI. Come parts of navigation and layout should be more distinctive from others depending on function.

<h5>Information Architecture</h5>
                  <p>
 Participants were commenting mostly on organization of content. Main menu and grouping of tasks were confusing and seemed disorganized in specific order. To improve on this area, there are couple different directions could be taken: do not group tasks at all, which will clear and shorten pathways, or organize them by experience that users will have: personal storage, browsing, mixing.
                  Content organization of general search was straightforward and clean. Nevertheless searching and sorting options could have more descriptive wording.
